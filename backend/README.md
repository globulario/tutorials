# Globular as Backend

In this section, I will guide you through the creation of a new microservice with Globular. Before creating your new microservice, it is important to keep in mind the following rules to ensure the effectiveness and maintainability of your microservice:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each microservice should have a single responsibility and perform a specific business capability or function. It should focus on doing one thing well. This ensures that the microservice remains cohesive and avoids becoming bloated with unrelated functionality.

2. **Loose Coupling:** Microservices should be loosely coupled, meaning they should have minimal dependencies on other services. They should communicate through well-defined interfaces, such as APIs or message queues, allowing them to evolve independently. This reduces the risk of changes in one microservice impacting others.

3. **Autonomous Development and Deployment:** Each microservice should be developed, deployed, and versioned independently. This allows different teams to work on different services simultaneously, using technologies and programming languages that best suit the service's requirements. It also enables independent scaling and updates without affecting the entire application.

4. **API Design and Documentation:** Microservices should expose well-defined and documented APIs that specify how other services or clients can interact with them. The APIs should be designed to be intuitive, consistent, and easy to use. Documentation plays a crucial role in facilitating communication and understanding between service providers and consumers.

5. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Microservices should be designed to handle failures gracefully. They should be resilient to transient errors and failures in other services. This can be achieved through techniques such as retries, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation. Resilient design ensures that the failure of one microservice does not bring down the entire system.

6. **Data Management:** Each microservice should have its own data storage and database. Data should be encapsulated within the microservice and not shared directly with other services. Proper data isolation and ownership boundaries should be established to maintain data consistency and prevent unauthorized access.

7. **Monitoring and Observability:** Microservices should be instrumented to provide monitoring and observability capabilities. This includes logging relevant events, metrics, and tracing information. Proper monitoring helps in understanding the system's behavior, identifying issues, and facilitating debugging.

8. **Security and Authentication:** Microservices should implement proper security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access. Authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented consistently across services. It's important to consider security aspects such as data encryption, input validation, and secure communication channels.

9. **Testing and Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD):** Microservices should be thoroughly tested in isolation and as part of the larger system. Automated testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, is crucial to ensure the correctness and reliability of each microservice. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines should be established to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

10. **Documentation and Collaboration:** Comprehensive documentation, including service contracts, API specifications, and architectural diagrams, should be maintained to facilitate collaboration among teams and ensure a shared understanding of the microservices architecture. Communication channels and tools should be established to encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Following these rules and best practices can help ensure the success of microservices architecture by promoting modularity, scalability, maintainability, and agility in the development process.
